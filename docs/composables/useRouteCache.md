# useRouteCache

Available in **Nuxt** and **Nitro**.

This composable is available when the
[Route Cache feature](/features/route-cache) is enabled. It allows you to
control if and how the current request should be cached.

## Full Example

```typescript
useRouteCache((helper) => {
  helper.setMaxAge(3600).setCacheable().addTags(['page:1'])
})
```

## Arguments

### callback?: `(cache: NuxtMultiCacheRouteCacheHelper) => void`

The callback that receives the route cache helper. The callback is only called
on the server.

### event?: `H3Event`

The optional `H3Event` event. This is not needed when the composable is called
in a Nuxt app context (e.g. plugin, other composables, component).

When called in a Nitro server context, the argument is required.

## Methods

### setCacheable()

Calling this will set the response to be cacheable. Note that if
`setUncacheable()` was called previously then this method does nothing. That way
we can make sure that for example sensitive information from authenticated users
is never cached.

### setUncacheable()

Mark the response as uncacheable. This decision is final and can't be reverted.
Usually this is used to prevent caching sensitive information from authenticated
users or to prevent caching broken pages.

**Example:** Request to external API fails and the component can't render the
data. Prevent the page from being cached in this broken state.

```vue
<template>
  <div v-if="weather">
    <!-- Render Weather -->
  </div>
  <div v-else>
    <p>Weather is currently not available.</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
const { data: weather } = await useAsyncData('weather', () => {
  return $fetch('/api/getWeather').catch(() => {
    // Prevent the page from being cached because this component failed to
    // fetch its data.
    useRouteCache((v) => v.setUncacheable())
  })
})
</script>
```

Alternatively you could also just reduce the max age for the page so that after
5 minutes the page is rendered again.

### setMaxAge(maxAge: number)

Set the max age in seconds for the cache entry. After that the page is rendered
again.

Note that cache entries remain in cache after they expired. When they expire the
route is rendered again and the response overwrites the stale cache entry.

### setStaleIfError(maxAge: number)

Set the "stale if error" in seconds for the cache entry. When set, a stale
cached route (in other words, a cache entry that would normally not be served
because it is expired) will be served if during rendering a 5xx error is thrown.

### allowStaleWhileRevalidate()

Allow a stale cached response to be served while a new one is being
"revalidated" (generated/rendered).

For example, if you have a page that does some external API call that takes a
lot of time, you can prevent "bombarding" that API by only doing one request at
a time. If that page becomes stale and if 10 people would request that page at
the same time, you would trigger 10 API calls. By setting
`allowStaleWhileRevalidate`, only the first request would trigger the API call
and the other 9 would receive a the stale response. Once the first request is
finished, every subsequent request would then receive the new, fresh response.

### addTags(tags: string[])

Add cache tags for the cache entry. They can be later used to purge specific
cache items.

**Example:** You can add a cache tag based on the current page language:
`language:de`. Later on, if some translations change you can invalidate all
cached pages in German:

```bash
curl -X POST -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '["language:de"]' \
  http://localhost:3000/__nuxt_multi_cache/purge/tags
```

### Instance Properties

The helper has three properties to keep track of the state:

- `tags: string[]`
- `cacheable: boolean|null`
- `maxAge: number|null`
- `staleIfError: number|null`

While absolutely not encouraged, you can directly manipulate these values for
specific edge cases.
